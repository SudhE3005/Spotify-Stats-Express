# Spotify-Stats-Express


This is a purely express js project with no server side javascript. The code will fetch your username and the top tracks and artists you enjoy listening to in different timelines( past 4 weeks, past 6 months and all time)

This project was done to test my understanding of node js/express js and OAuth 2.0 Authorization while working with the spotify API.

My next project would be a continuation to this project which will use a client side js (probably react) to present the data that i will be recieving from the spotify API in similar fashion as this one.

# Usage

Install the required dependencies by 

> npm i 

In the directory, run

> npm run devStart

to run the server and open http://localhost:6969/ to see the output.

Advicing to use a JSON beautifier extention in your browser (like JSON viewer pro) to make the json form readable.
